**Key Features:**

* User registration and login (Patients, Doctors, Admin)  
* Appointment booking system with calendar view  
* Patient medical records management  
* Search and filter appointments  
* Email/SMS notifications  
* Admin panel for system management

### **2- Library Management System**

**Objectives:**

* Register members and catalog books efficiently  
* Implement borrowing and return system with due dates  
* Automatically calculate fines for late returns  
* Provide search and filter functionality for books

* Manage book reservations

**Key Features:**

* Member registration and authentication  
* Book catalog with search and filters  
* Borrowing and return management  
* Fine calculation system  
* Reservation system for unavailable books

### **3- Task Management Platform**

*(Title inferred from content)*

Teams struggle to track tasks and projects effectively. There's no clear visibility on who is working on what, leading to missed deadlines and poor collaboration. Communication about task progress is scattered across different platforms.

* Track task status (To-Do, In Progress, Done)  
* Implement comment system for task discussions  
* Attach files to tasks  
* Display productivity dashboard with statistics  
* Send notifications for overdue tasks  
* Generate team performance reports

**Key Features:**

* User authentication (Team members, Managers)  
* Project creation and management  
* Task assignment with priorities  
* Status tracking and updates  
* Comments and file attachments  
* Dashboard with charts and statistics  
* Notifications system

### **4- Food Ordering Platform**

Small restaurants lack their own online ordering platforms, forcing them to rely on expensive third-party services. Customers want a convenient way to order food from home with real-time order tracking. The current system is inefficient and lacks transparency.

**Objectives:**

* Display food menu with images, descriptions, and prices  
* Implement shopping cart and checkout system  
* Track order status in real-time  
* Allow customers to rate dishes and provide feedback  
* Provide restaurant dashboard for order management
